# 🎓 Computer Engineering - UAL

Welcome to my repository! Here I document my journey through the **Computer Engineering Degree** (*Grado en Ingeniería Informática*) at the **University of Almería (UAL)**.

The purpose of this repository is to centralize all code-related coursework and laboratory exercises developed during my studies.

Since my classes are in Spanish, **most of the code and comments are in Spanish**. However, I will try to make the `README` of each project bilingual (English/Spanish) so it's easier to follow.
